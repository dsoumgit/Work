* Context API solves the issue where we pass the props manually through 
*   the component tree at every level.
* Context API provides a way to make particular data available to all components 
*   throughout the component tree without having to pass props down manually 
*   at every level. With Context, every component in the component tree has 
*   access to whatever data we decide to put in our context.
* We use React.createContext() to create a context object. It can pass anything as 
*   an argument.
